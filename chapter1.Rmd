# About the project

*"This is a Massive Open Online Couse (MOOC) meaning that everything you need to complete the course in terms of materials and exercises will be freely available online."*  **When I first started to think about learning online. I realized that this is a good opportunity for me because like all of us, as well I have very limited time to use to learn new skills.  MOOC concept is equal for everybody and benefits everybody of us who have "whatever reason" could not come to a traditional classroom setting. There is so much I wish to learn about using R and data analytics. Fortunately, I have quite good basic knowledge about biostatistics but I have only very basic skills using R.   After the first exercise I found that online learning does seem to take at least the same time as traditional classroom learning, but you can decide when you put your effort on learning. I heard about this course from the UEFÂ´s Doctoral Programme in Clinical Research coordinator and prof. Reijo Sund.**
